### Ride Share Summary

## Overview of the analysis
 The purpose of this analysis is to review ride share data by week and by city type and have it graphed to see how business plans can be best utilized and where resources should be poured into. 

## Results
 Between the different tpyes of cities, Urban has the largest sum of fares, drivers, and rides. Rural has the lowest of these three categories but we can see that the due to the fewer drives, the fares are actually higher per ride and driver. We can use this data to determine that there is a very high demand for ride share in Urban areas as the difference between the total rides and drivers and fares in Urban areas is very signifcant. 
	
## Summary
   - With the rural areas we see that the costs of fare per ride is $10 higher than Urban areas. We could look at the fare rates fro the areas due to the limited number of drivers and see if we would be able to drive up business in that area.
   - Between Urban and Suburban we see that while have over double the ride amount yet less than double in total fare increases, there is also a large pool of drivers in urban areas which overall drives down revenue and the fare per driver. We should look at the costs per driver and number of driver in the areas to see how we to handle saturation of drivers for Urban areas.  
   - Overall by incentivising riders to use the ride share app we can see healthy increases of drivers for each area as well as utilize all drivers in urban areas.
